**Code Fellows 401 Final Project**

Penetration Testing and Defensive Recommendations</br>
December 15, 2020

## Abstract
Scenrio - Our team is a small security firm that accepted a new contract to help ABC Corp. test its infrastructure and implement more sophisticated security systems. This is a "purple team" engagement. We were tasked with completing a penetration test, composing relevant deliverables, and presenting the findings to your client. We implemented threat detection and advance malware analysis tools in the environment as part of boosting the client's defenses.

For this scenario, our team was provided access to a unique black box AWS cloud instance for penetration testing.
