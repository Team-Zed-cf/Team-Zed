**Code Fellows 401 Final Project**

Penetration Testing and Defensive Recommendations</br>
December 15, 2020

## Project Overview
Scenario - Our team is a small security firm that accepted a new contract to help "ABC Corp." test its infrastructure and implement more sophisticated security systems. This is a "purple team" engagement. We were tasked with completing a penetration test, composing relevant deliverables, and presenting the findings to your client. We implemented threat detection and advance malware analysis tools in the environment as part of boosting the client's defenses.

For this scenario, our team was provided access to a unique black box AWS cloud instance for penetration testing.

In the final segment of the project week, our team gained access to *Vintage Upholstery & Leather Nationwide Corporation's* systems to implement defensive systems in the environment.

### Jin Kim
Jin is aspiring cloud security engineer who's always in search of learn new skills and expand on my knowledge in security. During my software development course, I learned how web application vulnerabilities can be exploited from multiple attack vectors and I found it fascinating. My network then eventually led me to security courses and I learned about creating secure network and also maintaining integrity of data on Cloud. I would love to expand my knowledge in containerization and agile development in the future while continually mentoring others to break into tech scene.
